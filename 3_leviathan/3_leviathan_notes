Solutions:

Level 0:
	- 'scp -P 2223 leviathan0@leviathan.labs.overthewire.org:~/.backup/bookmarks.html ./bookmarks.html' to get the bookmarks.html
	- open it and search for 'leviathan'
	- check the element and the password will be in the a tag's href attribute
	- Password: 3QJ3TgzHDq

Level 1:
	- check is an ELF file
	- run ltrace ./check and from that we can see that the password is 'sex'
	- we are now logged in as user 'leviathan2' and run 'cat /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan2' 
	- Password: NsN1HwFoyN 

Level 2:
	- create a temp folder and make a file called "test file.txt"
	- create a symlink with the /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan3: 'ln -s /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan3 /tmp/{temp_folder}/test' 
	- 'chmod 777 /tmp/{temp_folder}' to make the files read/writable
	- run './printfile /tmp/{temp_folder}/"test file.txt"' to get the password
	- when the above is run the /bin/cat reads from /tmp/{temp_folder}/test and ./file.txt (due to the space in the name)
	- also the access() will see that /tmp/{temp_folder}/test is readable thus allowing for user id change
	- Password: f0n8h2iWLP

Level 3:
	- same as level 1 but the password here is 'snlprintf'
	- Password: WG1egElCvO

Level 4:
	- run './trash/bin'
	- convert the binary to text and there is the password
	- Password: 0dyxT7F4QD

Level 5:
	- '~/leviathan5' reads the /tmp/file.log file so let's trick it >:)
	- 'ln -s /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan6 /tmp/file.log'
	- run './leviathan5' and the password is revealed
	- Password: szo7HDB88w
