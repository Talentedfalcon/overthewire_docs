Solutions:

Level 0:
	- running './behemoth0' it asks for a password
	- using gdb, we see that password is used for a simple strcmp() with a variable
	- now we need to get that variable
	- it's address is found in $ebp-0x55
	- 'x/s <addr_variable>' will give the variable which is 'eatmyshorts'

Level 1:
	- in './behemoth1' there is buffer of size 68
	- this buffer get an input during runtime with gets()
	- we need to overflow and change a return address which points to a shellcode
	- here 'behemoth1_shellcode' is used
	- run 'export SHELLCODE=$(python3 -c "import sys;sys.stdout.buffer.write('<shellcode>')")'
	- to get SHELLCODE env's address:
		- copy 'behemoth1_shellcode_addr.c' in /tmp/ of the behemoth.labs
		- run 'gcc -m32 behemoth1_shellcode_addr.c -o a.out'
		- run './a.out SHELLCODE'
		- now we have SHELLCODE_addr
	- (python3 -c 'import sys;sys.stdout.buffer.write(71*b"\x90"+b"<SHELLCODE_addr(in LE)>")';cat) | ./behemoth1

Level 2:
	- in this program 'touch' command is called but without using absolute path
	- so we need to make our own "touch" script and add that touch's path to the $PATH env
	- create a tmp folder and give it full permissions (chmod 777)
	- inside the folder make a "touch" script that runs '/etc/behemoth_pass/behemoth3' (make it executable)
	- now run '/behemoth/behemoth2'
